# Getting Started #

Download the following

Visual Studio Express C# 2008 - http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#Visual_Studio_2008_Express_Downloads

I also suggest TortoiseSVN to get the source - http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads

# Downloading the Source #

Create an empty folder somewhere.  Right click on it.  You should see an SVN Checkout... option in the context menu.

You should see all the source files appear in the Solution Explorer tab.  Either press F5, or click the green triangle at the top.  You will see a little message in the lower left corner when the build succeeded.
